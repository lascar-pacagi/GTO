## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Build the hand evaluator tables

```bash
g++ -std=c++20 -O2 -o hand_eval hand_eval.cpp
./hand_eval  # Generates poker_tables.bin (~60KB)
```

### Step 2: Test the postflop game

```bash
g++ -std=c++20 -O2 -o test_postflop test_postflop.cpp
./test_postflop
```

Expected output:
```
Postflop Poker Test
===================
Flop: 2c 2d 2h
P1: Ac Ah
P2: Kc Kh
...
Winner: P1
P1 payoff: 10
P2 payoff: -10
```

### Step 3: Run the DCFR solver (coming soon)

```bash
g++ -std=c++20 -O2 -o test_dcfr test_dcfr_solver.cpp
./test_dcfr
```

## 📊 Game Tree Size Analysis

Without abstraction, a typical postflop scenario has:

| Range Size | Tree Nodes | Memory Required |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| 50 combos each | ~100 billion | ~400 GB |
| 200 combos each | ~10 trillion | ~40 TB |
| 500 combos each | ~100 trillion | ~400 TB |

**Abstraction is essential!**

### Recommended Abstractions

1. **Card Isomorphism** (lossless) - 75% reduction
2. **Action Abstraction** (3-6 bet sizes) - 95% reduction
3. **Hand Bucketing** (50-200 buckets) - 95% reduction
4. **Board Bucketing** (200-1000 flops) - 95% reduction

**Combined:** 100 trillion → **~100 million nodes** (manageable!)

## 🔬 Key Algorithms Explained

### Discounted CFR (DCFR)

The state-of-the-art variant of CFR used by commercial solvers:

**Key parameters:**
```cpp
GAMMA = 3.0  // Regret discount (not 2.0!)
ALPHA = 1.5  // Positive regret discount
```

**Update formula:**
```cpp
if (regret[i] > 0) {
    regret[i] = regret[i] * t^(-γ) + instant_regret
} else {
    regret[i] = regret[i] * t^(-α) + instant_regret
}
```

**Strategy reset:** Clear avg_strategy at iterations 4, 16, 64, 256, ...

**Convergence:** ~5x faster than CFR+ in practice

### Hand Bucketing

Group similar hands to reduce complexity:

```cpp
HandBucketer bucketer(50);  // 50 buckets

double ehs = bucketer.calculate_ehs(
    hole_cards, board, num_board_cards, evaluator
);

int bucket = bucketer.get_bucket(ehs);  // 0-49
```

**Reduction:** 1,326 hands → 50 buckets = **97% smaller**

## 📈 Performance Targets

Based on TexasSolver and postflop-solver benchmarks:

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Convergence | < 5 min | Simple flop (50 buckets, 3 bet sizes) |
| Memory | < 2 GB | With compression |
| Accuracy | < 0.5% | Exploitability metric |
| Parallelization | 4-8x | On 8-core CPU |

## 🔧 Advanced Features (Future)

### Bunching Effect
When some hands fold, remaining hands have different distributions.

```cpp
// Adjust probabilities based on folded cards
double adjusted_prob = get_prob_with_bunching(hand, folded_cards);
```

### Safe Subgame Solving
- Solve coarse abstraction for full game
- Re-solve fine abstraction for subgames during play
- Used in Libratus and Pluribus

### Neural Network Approximation
- Train NN to approximate hand values
- Reduce memory by 100x+
- Faster online play
